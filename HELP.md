## Understanding Sudoku

### The Basics

Sudoku is a logic-based number puzzle played on a 9×9 grid divided into nine 3×3 boxes.

**The Rules:**
- Each row must contain the numbers 1-9 exactly once
- Each column must contain the numbers 1-9 exactly once
- Each 3×3 box must contain the numbers 1-9 exactly once
- Some numbers are pre-filled (these are called "clues" or "givens")
- Your goal is to fill all empty cells following these rules

### Grid Layout

The puzzle grid uses visual cues to help you navigate:

- **Thick borders** separate the nine 3×3 boxes
- **Thin lines** separate individual cells within boxes
- **Pre-filled numbers** (clues) are shown in bold and cannot be changed
- **Your entries** appear in a different style to distinguish them from clues

## Input Methods

Sudoku Face Off supports two input methods, allowing you to choose what works best for your solving style.

### Cell First (Noun-Verb) Method

**How it works:**
1. Tap an empty cell on the grid
2. The cell highlights, along with its row, column, and 3×3 box
3. Tap a number on the number pad
4. The number is placed in the selected cell

**Best for:** Beginners and players who solve linearly, cell by cell.

**Visual feedback:**
- Selected cell is highlighted
- Row, column, and box are subtly highlighted
- All instances of the selected number are highlighted

### Digit First (Verb-Noun) Method

**How it works:**
1. Tap a number on the number pad (e.g., "5")
2. The number becomes active (highlighted on the pad)
3. All existing 5s on the board are highlighted
4. Tap empty cells to place 5s in them
5. The number stays active until you select a different number

**Best for:** Speed solving and advanced players who scan for specific numbers.

**Visual feedback:**
- Active number is highlighted on the number pad
- All instances of that number on the board are highlighted
- When all 9 instances of a number are placed, the number pad button dims

**Smart features:**
- Tapping an existing number switches your selection to that number
- Tapping the same number again deselects it
- Long-press a cell to clear it without changing your active number

### Switching Between Methods

You can seamlessly switch between methods:

- **No number selected**: Tap a cell → Cell First mode
- **Number selected**: Tap cells → Digit First mode
- The app automatically adapts to your input pattern

---

## Notes (Pencil Mode)

### What Are Notes?

Notes (also called "pencil marks" or "candidates") are small numbers you can write in cells to track possible values. They help you work through logic without committing to a number.

### Activating Note Mode

1. Tap the **note mode button** (pencil icon) in the stats bar
2. The button highlights to show note mode is active
3. Now when you tap numbers, they'll be added as notes instead of final answers

### Adding Notes

**In Cell First mode:**
1. Select a cell
2. Activate note mode
3. Tap numbers on the pad to add them as notes

**In Digit First mode:**
1. Select a number (e.g., "5")
2. Activate note mode
3. Tap empty cells to add 5 as a note in those cells

### Note Display

Notes appear as small numbers arranged in a 3×3 grid within the cell:
- Top row: 1, 2, 3
- Middle row: 4, 5, 6
- Bottom row: 7, 8, 9

### Removing Notes

- **Toggle off**: Tap the same number again in note mode to remove it
- **Auto-removal**: When you place a final number, conflicting notes in the same row, column, and box are automatically removed

### When to Use Notes

- **Easy puzzles**: Usually not needed
- **Medium puzzles**: Helpful for tracking possibilities
- **Hard/Master puzzles**: Essential for advanced techniques

## Hints System

### Overview

Sudoku Face Off features an intelligent hint system that teaches you solving techniques rather than just revealing answers. This helps you learn and improve your skills.

3. The hint mode screen appears with:
   - A scaled-down view of the board (for reference)

The app teaches various techniques:

**Basic Techniques:**
