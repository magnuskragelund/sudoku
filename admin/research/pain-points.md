# Common Pain Points with Sudoku Apps

Common pain points with Sudoku on phones and tablets tend to cluster around UX, monetization, and puzzle quality.

## UI and Interaction

- Small touch targets make it easy to mis-tap cells or numbers, causing accidental mistakes and frustration.
- Hand/finger often covers part of the grid while tapping, making it harder to visually scan patterns compared to paper or larger screens.
- Poor note (candidate) handling, such as buggy auto-removal or inconsistent behavior, breaks trust in the app's assistance features.

## Ads and Monetization

- Full-screen ads that interrupt mid-puzzle break concentration and flow, especially when they appear after every few moves or number clears.
- High data usage from constantly loaded ads can surprise users with bandwidth costs, especially on mobile connections.
- Paywalls or pricey "remove ads" options feel disproportionate for a simple puzzle game, leading to dissatisfaction.

## Puzzle Difficulty and Generation

- "Hard" or "expert" modes are often too easy, solvable with only basic strategies, which bores advanced players seeking serious challenges.
- Difficulty labeling can be unreliable or inconsistent, with some "master" tiers actually easier than lower levels due to poor generation or rating logic.
- Lack of truly advanced techniques (e.g., complex chains, advanced wings) means players rarely get puzzles that require skills they want to practice.

## Feature Gaps for Serious Players

- Missing or weak hint systems that do not teach techniques, just tell the next move, limit learning and long-term engagement.
- Limited control over tools like auto-candidates, error checking, or step-by-step solving makes some apps feel either too "cheaty" or too bare-bones.
- Inability to input custom puzzles (e.g., from books or websites) prevents using one preferred interface to solve all puzzles.

## Cognitive and Usability Issues

- Over-reliance on automation (auto notes, highlighting, error flags) can give players an inflated sense of skill and make manual solving feel tedious later.
- Some users feel the solving process becomes mechanical: scanning grid for named patterns in a fixed order, which can feel like following software logic rather than playing a game.
- When apps highlight mistakes immediately, players may lean on trial-and-error instead of learning proper logical reasoning, which reduces satisfaction.
