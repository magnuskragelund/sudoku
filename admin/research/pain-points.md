# Common Pain Points with Sudoku Apps

Common pain points with Sudoku on phones and tablets tend to cluster around UX, monetization, and puzzle quality.

## UI and Interaction

- Small touch targets make it easy to mis-tap cells or numbers, causing accidental mistakes and frustration.
- Hand/finger often covers part of the grid while tapping, making it harder to visually scan patterns compared to paper or larger screens.
- Poor note (candidate) handling, such as buggy auto-removal or inconsistent behavior, breaks trust in the app's assistance features.

## Ads and Monetization

- Full-screen ads that interrupt mid-puzzle break concentration and flow, especially when they appear after every few moves or number clears.
- High data usage from constantly loaded ads can surprise users with bandwidth costs, especially on mobile connections.
- Paywalls or pricey "remove ads" options feel disproportionate for a simple puzzle game, leading to dissatisfaction.

## Puzzle Difficulty and Generation

- "Hard" or "expert" modes are often too easy, solvable with only basic strategies, which bores advanced players seeking serious challenges.
- Difficulty labeling can be unreliable or inconsistent, with some "master" tiers actually easier than lower levels due to poor generation or rating logic.
- Lack of truly advanced techniques (e.g., complex chains, advanced wings) means players rarely get puzzles that require skills they want to practice.

## Feature Gaps for Serious Players

- Missing or weak hint systems that do not teach techniques, just tell the next move, limit learning and long-term engagement.
- Limited control over tools like auto-candidates, error checking, or step-by-step solving makes some apps feel either too "cheaty" or too bare-bones.
- Inability to input custom puzzles (e.g., from books or websites) prevents using one preferred interface to solve all puzzles.

## Cognitive and Usability Issues

- Over-reliance on automation (auto notes, highlighting, error flags) can give players an inflated sense of skill and make manual solving feel tedious later.
- Some users feel the solving process becomes mechanical: scanning grid for named patterns in a fixed order, which can feel like following software logic rather than playing a game.
- When apps highlight mistakes immediately, players may lean on trial-and-error instead of learning proper logical reasoning, which reduces satisfaction.


Based on an analysis of user discussions, feedback threads, and feature wishlists from Reddit (r/sudoku, r/androidapps) and Facebook community feedback loops, here are the top three requested Sudoku app features that are often missing or poorly implemented in mainstream apps.

1. "Smart" Hints That Teach Logic (Not Just "Reveal")

The most frequent complaint about standard Sudoku apps is that their "Hint" button simply fills in a random cell with the correct number. Users repeatedly express a desire for a system that acts as a tutor—pointing out where to look and explaining the technique (e.g., "Look for an X-Wing in rows 3 and 7") without spoiling the answer.

User Quote (Reddit):

"Hints that teach and not just reveal... unlike other apps, they not only give you a solution, but you also get a detailed description of how to reach a solved cell."

User Quote (Reddit):

"I would love to see an app... where pressing hint gives you an idea of which cell to look out for. Then you can look at it stepwise. Then finally, it gives you the revealed number. Sometimes all you need is a nudge."

User Quote (Reddit):

"The hint feature is worthless, but the analyze feature [in other apps] is priceless. You can import game collections... it’s a good way to find out what the hardest step is."

2. Advanced Candidate Coloring & Chain Visualization

As users progress to harder puzzles (requiring techniques like X-Wings, Swordfish, or Forcing Chains), they need to visually track logical implications. A common frustration is the inability to "color" specific candidates or cells (e.g., painting one candidate green and its pair red) to visualize a chain. Standard apps usually only allow simple pencil marks.

User Quote (Reddit):

"A way to colour cells so as to track a certain chain of reasoning would be good... In my experience, I don't always need color, but I often find myself wishing it was there."

User Quote (Reddit):

"Ability to highlight squares different colors... At least four, but preferably 6 colours... I want to draw arrows to indicate strong and weak links."

User Quote (Facebook/General Feedback):

"I really like the highlight feature for all penciled same numbers! Seriously the only thing it maybe missing [is better tracking]."

3. "Snapshot" or "Save State" Functionality

Many users ask for a "sandbox" or "snapshot" feature. When facing a bifurcation (a point where the puzzle splits into two possible paths), players want to save their current state, try a path, and if it fails, instantly revert to the saved state. Currently, users have to manually "Undo" dozens of times, often forgetting where they started.

User Quote (Reddit):

"I have a snapshot feature on my to-do list, so you can create a snapshot of the current state, try something, and go back to that snapshot later."

User Quote (Reddit):

"It would be nice to have an option to just check for errors, because if it's just a technique I'm missing I would rather keep working on it until I find the technique, rather than getting that next step spoiled."

User Quote (Reddit):

"I like to just play and see if it fails later. That's kind of the fun for me... but it's pretty annoying to be honest [when the app tells you immediately]."
