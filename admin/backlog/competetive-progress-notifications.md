As a player playing a muliplayer game 
i want to see a progress indicator, indicating how far the best of my opponents have come in their game
so that competetive element of the multiplayer game is encreased.

the progress indicator has to be quite compact and should be placed in the blue "multiplayer bar".

As a host
i want to be able to control whether or not the progress bar should be visible in the game or not, before starting the game.
