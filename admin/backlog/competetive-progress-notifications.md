As a player playing a muliplayer game 
i want to see a progressbar indicating how far the best of my opponents have come in their game
so that competetive element of the multiplayer game is encreased.

As a host
i want to be able to controld whether or not the progress bar should be visible in the game or not, before starting the game.
